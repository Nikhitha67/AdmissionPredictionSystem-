AdmissionPredictionSystem-
This project focuses on predicting a student's chance of admission into a university program based on academic and profile scores. Using a publicly available dataset, the system analyzes features like GRE scores, TOEFL scores, CGPA, university rating, and research experience to estimate the probability of admission. Multiple machine learning algorithms were explored and compared to identify the most accurate model.

Features:
Predicts probability of admission based on input scores
Implements various regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN
Uses GridSearchCV and cross-validation for model selection
Visualizes score distributions using histograms

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
numpy
matplotlib

Applications:
Helps students assess their admission chances more accurately
Useful for advisors and counselors to guide applicants
Can be extended into a user-friendly prediction tool or web application
